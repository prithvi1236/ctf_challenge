# üîí Cryptic Shadows CTF Challenge

A multi-layered cryptography challenge designed for intermediate CTF participants. Follow the trail of encrypted messages left by the rogue agent "Specter" to recover the Obsidian Key.

## üìã Challenge Description

**Category:** Cryptography  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate  
**Estimated Time:** 30-60 minutes  
**Required Skills:** Basic cryptographic knowledge, logical thinking, pattern recognition

## üéØ Challenge Overview

You are an agent of the secretive organization "Shadow Cipher," tasked with recovering a lost artifact known as the "Obsidian Key." The key is locked in a digital vault protected by a series of cryptographic puzzles. A rogue agent, codenamed "Specter," has left behind encrypted messages to taunt you.

Your mission is to:
1. Decrypt the initial message to find the hidden file
2. Decode the binary data to uncover the next clue
3. Solve the final vault puzzle to retrieve the flag
