# üîí Cryptic Shadows CTF Challenge

A multi-layered cryptography challenge designed for intermediate CTF participants. Follow the trail of encrypted messages left by the rogue agent "Specter" to recover the Obsidian Key.

## üìã Challenge Description

**Category:** Cryptography  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate  
**Estimated Time:** 30-60 minutes  
**Required Skills:** Basic cryptographic knowledge, logical thinking, pattern recognition

## üéØ Challenge Overview

You are an agent of the secretive organization "Shadow Cipher," tasked with recovering a lost artifact known as the "Obsidian Key." The key is locked in a digital vault protected by a series of cryptographic puzzles. A rogue agent, codenamed "Specter," has left behind encrypted messages to taunt you.

Your mission is to:
1. Decrypt the initial message to find the hidden file
2. Decode the binary data to uncover the next clue
3. Solve the final vault puzzle to retrieve the flag

## üß© Challenge Structure

### Layer 1: The Ciphered Note
- **Ciphertext:** `MJQXZJMLTKZSIJHLTKAFHKLQXJ`
- **Hint:** "Shift your perspective, as Caesar would, but the key lies in the shadows of the first."
- **Solution:** Vigen√®re cipher with key derived from challenge name

### Layer 2: The Hidden File
- **Data:** Binary string encoding "Hello world"
- **Hint:** "Look beyond the greeting; the shadow hides in the base."
- **Solution:** Binary to ASCII, then base64 encoding of bit count

### Layer 3: The Final Vault
- **Ciphertext:** `QVFSDAKZTKAF`
- **Hint:** "The shadow's fifth letter holds the key to victory."
- **Solution:** Vigen√®re cipher with key from challenge name

## üèÜ Flag Format

The final flag follows standard CTF format: `flag{AFTERSHADOWS}`
